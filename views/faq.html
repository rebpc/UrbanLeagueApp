<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">The mission of the Austin Area urban League is to assist African Americans and all other under-served Austin area residents in the achievement of societal and economic equality by focusing on educational improvement, employment readiness, health and wellness, and the preservation of affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>OUR ORGANIZATION</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">The National Urban League is a historic civil rights organization dedicated to economic empowerment in order to elevate the standard of living in historically underserved urban communities. Founded in 1910 and headquartered in New York City, the National Urban League spearheads the efforts of its local affiliates through the development of programs, public policy research and advocacy. Today, there are more than 100 local affiliates in 36 states and the District of Columbia, providing direct services that impact and improve the lives of more than 2 million people nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>OUR MOVEMENT</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">The Austin Area Urban League incorporated on August 12, 1977, stands proudly as it takes its place among the 96 affiliates of the National Urban League.  Although 36 years have passed since its creation, the Austin Area Urban League continues to hold fast to our original mission; one which guides our outreach, programming, partnerships and advocacy.  We envision a community in which all citizens are free from barriers to education, economic and social success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Over the years, significant steps have been made in removing the early prejudices and barriers, thus allowing many of our constituents to learn to grow, and to thrive in the Austin community.  As we move forward with our programs, we have been able to adapt to the ever-changing Austin environment â€“ one that has grown from being merely the state capital to that of a thriving technological hub that incorporates the community, government, and the business sectors.</span></p>
